    <h2>The Halloween Store</h2>

    <h3>For the little Goblin in all of us!</h3>

    <h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

    <div>
        <p> I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
            holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
            Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.<br><br>If you click
            on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Haloween pictures, stories,
            and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up=to-date on 
            all things Halloween.
